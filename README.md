# Smart Flower

My plant is dying because I haven't been taking proper care of it. 😔
So, I decided to create a PCB that can be placed in the soil of the vase.
It uses an ESP32, which has both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, allowing me to program it to send notifications when the soil needs water. 🛜
I can also create a website to store and display all the plant data, like how often I water it each day. 📊

The PCB includes a DHT11 sensor to monitor the air temperature and humidity, and I've added a MAX17048G to keep track of the battery voltage.
It also features a TP4056 module for charging the battery. 🔋

To make it visually appealing, I'll design a 3D-printed case that looks like a flower to house the PCB. 🌼
It'll look awesome in the vase! I created this PCB using EasyEDA Pro! 🛠️
